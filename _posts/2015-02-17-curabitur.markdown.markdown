Hi, my name is Ashlee. 

I am an Informatics, Business, and Computer Science Student at Indiana University. I am passionate about the intersection of technology, fitness, and innovation as a vehicle to both change lives and empower people everywhere. 

Because I am an enthusiastic, results-driven, team-oriented individual, I aspire to be apart of a competitive and collaborative environment that uses the power of innovative collaboration to drive success.
